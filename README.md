spotify-clone
A ReactJS clone application of the popular Spotify music streaming service. This application utilizes the Spotify API and the Spotify Web Playback SDK.
 A clone web application using the create-react-app. The app consumes data from the Spotify API and tries to mimic the UI and front-end behaviour of the official Spotify web player as much as possible.
 Like the official app, if a user is not authenticated, they can still browse and look up different playlists, albums, artists and users. Non authenticated users cannot control the player.
 No direct streaming is available through the API.
