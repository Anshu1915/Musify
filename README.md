spotify-clone
A ReactJS clone application of the popular Spotify music streaming service. This application utilizes the Spotify API and the Spotify Web Playback SDK.
 A clone web application using the create-react-app. The app consumes data from the Spotify API and tries to mimic the UI and front-end behaviour of the official Spotify web player as much as possible.
 Like the official app, if a user is not authenticated, they can still browse and look up different playlists, albums, artists and users. Non authenticated users cannot control the player.
 No direct streaming is available through the API.
GOAL OF PROJECT:
    The goal of a Spotify-Clone project using MERN Stack development is to create a web application that mimics the functionality and features of the popular music           streaming platform, Spotify.
    MERN Stack refers to the use of four technologies: MongoDB (a NoSQL database), Express.js (a web application framework for Node.js), React (a frontend JavaScript         library), and Node.js (a server-side JavaScript runtime). Using this technology stack, developers can create a full-stack web application that allows users to listen     to music, create playlists, browse new releases, and interact with other users.
    The Spotify-Clone project aims to replicate the core features of Spotify, such as user authentication, music streaming, and playlist management.
    Overall, the goal of a Spotify-Clone project using MERN Stack development is to create a high-quality, scalable, and user-friendly music streaming application that       provides a similar experience to the original platform.
PROCESS OF PROJECT:
    Using MERN Stack development, I begin by setting up the development environment and installing the necessary tools and dependencies. This includes installing Node.js     and MongoDB on the server, as well as installing the required Node.js modules such as Express.js and Mongoose. 
    ->Planning: involves defining the project requirements, identifying the target audience. features such as user authentication, music streaming, and playlist                         management. 
    ->Designing. 
    ->Backend Development: involves building the server-side components of the application, such as setting up the database schema, creating RESTful APIs for data             retrieval and manipulation, and configuring server-side logic using Express.js. 
    ->Frontend:  involves building the client-side components of the application, such as creating React components, styling them using CSS, and integrating them with                    the backend APIs. 
    ->Testing: the application is tested for functionality, usability, and performance.
               Maintenance and Updates: After deployment, the application will require ongoing maintenance, updates, and bug fixes to ensure it remains functional and                   up-to-date.
 FEATURES:
     ->User Authentication: Users should be able to create accounts, log in and log out securely. 
     ->Music Streaming: The main feature of a Spotify clone is to allow users to stream music. This can be implemented using third-party APIs like the Spotify Web API.        Music Recommendations: Spotify is known for its personalized music recommendations. 
     ->Playlist Creation and Management: Users should be able to create playlists, add songs to them, and manage them. This could be implemented using MongoDB to store            playlist data. 
     ->Search Functionality: Users should be able to search for songs, albums, artists, and playlists.  
     ->Responsive Design: The app should be designed to work on different devices and screen sizes. This could involve using media queries and CSS frameworks like              Bootstrap or Material UI. 
     ->Admin Dashboard: The app may require an admin dashboard to manage user accounts, music metadata, and other backend functionality. This could be built using                 React and a backend like Express.
 INSTALLATION:
 step 1: Install Node.js: Install Node.js on your system. You can download it from the official website (https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

 step 2:Install MongoDB: Install MongoDB on your system. You can download it from the official website (https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community).

step 3:Clone the project: Clone the Spotify clone project from the GitHub repository (https://github.com/lucasnaja/spotify-clone-mern.git) to your local machine.

step 3:Install dependencies: Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run the command 'npm install' to install all the required dependencies.

step 4:Set up environment variables: Create a '.env' file in the root directory of the project and add the following variables:
      MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/spotify-clone
           JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key_here
      Replace your_secret_key_here with a random string of characters that will be used to sign JSON Web Tokens.

step 5: Start the server: Run the command 'npm run' server to start the server.

step 6: Start the client: Open a new terminal window, navigate to the project directory, and run the command 'npm run client' to start the React client.

step 7: Access the application: Open your browser and navigate to 'http://localhost:3000' to access the Spotify clone application.
